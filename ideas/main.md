- We might want to generate ids, either by having rooms added to the document
  through a function/command line thing or by running through the document and
  inserting them. The latter approach has certain advantages but you would need
  to run the inserter every time you want to figure out how to link to a room.
- array or dict to store each room:
    - \[prompt text, \[\[choice text, choice number/reference\],...\]\]
